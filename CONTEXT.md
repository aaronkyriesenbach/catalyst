# Homelab Platform

The `catalyst` repo's home-lab Kubernetes platform: physical infrastructure, cluster lifecycle, shared
platform services, and the app-config layer that renders workloads onto it.

## Language

**Bootstrap layer**:
The physical, pre-cluster layer — Proxmox, TrueNAS, and Unifi — provisioned declaratively before any
Kubernetes cluster exists.
_Avoid_: physical layer, infra layer (as formal terms; fine in casual prose)
